Source for the Linux sauce.

The recipe requires the following ingredients:

- A whole bottle of vermouth.
- A big yellow onion.
- Brown sugar.
- Salty soy sauce.

The first step is to cut the onion into thin slices.
Then, add them to a pan with a bit of oil and let them caramelize.
Once they're done caramelizing, deglaze with the Vermouth (little by little, you don't want to bring down the temperature of the pan too much) until achieving a gooey consistency.
Add a tablespoon of the brown sugar, and wait for it to incorporate.
Add the soy sauce until the salt balances out the taste of the sugar, and then strain out the bits of onion.

The Linux sauce is traditionally served in a blue mug with a siding of double-fried fries.

At the end, the result should look like this:

## History of the sauce

Historians believe the sauce originated sometime during the twenty-first century in the Democratic Republic of Louvain-li-Nuxistan.
Although there is no archaeological evidence to support its existence, the full recipe was recorded in the Magna Carta and multiple contemporary civilizations also reference it in their texts.

In 2023, a group of researchers modeled what the ratios of the sauce might have been after archaeologists found a half-emptied bottle of Vermouth and a blue mug in a cave (alongside a broken-in-two floor squeegee).
Their estimates matched up with the ratios in the Magna Carta, which not only proves the existence of the sauce, but also suggests the Magna Carta is able to predict things far into the future.
