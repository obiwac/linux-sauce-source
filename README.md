# linux-sauce-source

Source for the Linux sauce.

The recipe requires the following ingredients:

- A whole bottle of vermouth.
- A big yellow onion.
- Brown sugar.
- Salty soy sauce.

The first step is to cut the onion into thin slices.
Then, add them to a pan with a bit of oil and let them caramelize.
Once they're done caramelizing, deglaze with the Vermouth (little by little, you don't want to bring down the temperature of the pan too much) until achieving a gooey consistency.
Add a tablespoon of the brown sugar, and wait for it to incorporate.
Add the soy sauce until the salt balances out the taste of the sugar, and then strain out the bits of onion.

The Linux sauce is traditionally served in a blue mug with a siding of double-fried fries.
